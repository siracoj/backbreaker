backbreaker
===========

Any person can be a user of the Back Breaker product. There will be 2 pressure sensors on the

chest strap, 2 on the shoulder-blade area, and 2 on the back area. This will be a total of 6 

pressure sensors, 3 on each side of the backpack. The pressure sensors will measure the force 

applied on the user from the backpack. 

With this data, we can determine if the user is properly wearing the backpack, if the backpack 

support pads are tearing, and if any excess force occurs in any area. This product can also be 

used for hiking and military purposes, seeing if the arrangements of products affect how much 

force in specific areas are being placed on the user.
